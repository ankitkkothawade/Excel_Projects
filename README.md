Throughout the project, various Excel functionalities were utilized for comprehensive data analysis, visualization, cleaning, and transformation. Excel functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT, VLOOKUP, and IF statements were employed for data manipulation and calculation, including the calculation of delivery charges, discounts, and summarization of order distribution. Statistical analysis techniques were applied to identify trends and patterns in the data.
